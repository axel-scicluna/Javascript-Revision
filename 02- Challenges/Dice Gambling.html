Dice Gambling
Create a function that takes an array consisting of dice rolls from 1-6. Return the sum of your rolls with the following conditions:

If a 1 is rolled, that is bad luck. The next roll counts as 0.
If a 6 is rolled, that is good luck. The next roll is multiplied by 2.
The array length will always be 3 or higher.
Examples
rolls([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 4
// The second roll, 2, counts as 0 as a result of rolling 1.

rolls([2, 6, 2, 5]) ➞ 17
// The 2 following the 6 was multiplied by 2.

rolls([6, 1, 1]) ➞ 8
// The first roll makes the second roll worth 2, but the
// second roll was still 1 so the third roll doesn't count.
